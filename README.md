    result: 'win' | 'loss',
    timestamp: ISO_string,
    date: formatted_date
  }
]

// Recent victories tracking
arena_recent_victories: [
  {
    championId: string,
    championName: string,

  }
]
```

### Data Persistence

## üîß Customization

### Adding New Champions
Update `champions.js`:
```javascript
const champions = [
    // Add new champions here
    { name: "New Champion", id: "newchampion" },
    // ...existing champions
];
```

### Adding New Aliases
Update the `aliasMatches` object in `app.js`:
```javascript
const aliasMatches = {
    'nickname': 'championid',
    // ...existing aliases
};
```

### Styling Modifications
The CSS uses CSS custom properties for easy theming:
```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #3b82f6;
    --accent-color: #8b5cf6;
    --success-color: #10b981;
    --error-color: #ef4444;
}
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Champion Images Not Loading
- The app includes automatic fallback to letter placeholders
- Uses Riot's official CDN for champion portraits
- Fallbacks work offline and handle API changes

### Search Not Finding Champions
- Try common nicknames (GP, MF, ASol)
- Use partial names (gang, miss, aurel)
- Check spelling and capitalization (case-insensitive)

### Import File Issues
- Ensure one champion name per line
- Use plain text (.txt) or CSV (.csv) files
- Check file encoding (UTF-8 recommended)

### Data Loss Prevention
- **Regular Backups**: Export JSON backup weekly
- **Before Browser Cleanup**: Always backup before clearing cookies/data
- **Device Migration**: Export on old device, import on new device
- **Backup Storage**: Save JSON files to cloud storage or external drive

### Backup/Restore Issues
- **CSV Won't Open**: Ensure you have Excel, Google Sheets, or text editor
- **JSON Import Fails**: Check file is valid JSON backup from this app
- **Missing Data After Import**: Backup may have been partial or corrupted
- **Duplicate Data**: App prevents duplicates automatically during import
